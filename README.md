# TopOpt-SLP-3D_julia
A Julia translation of the TopOpt-SLP-3D Matlab repository for 3D structural topology optimization created by Alfredo Vitorino and Francisco A. M. Gomes. It uses Sequential Linear Programming (SLP) to maximize stiffness under a volume constraint. Advanced features like multigrid and multiresolution are not yet implemented.
